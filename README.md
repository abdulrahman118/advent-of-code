# What is Advent of Code?
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
> Every day for 25 days in December month you have small programming challenges that you need to solve to complete the "tree". Each day, the questions get a little bit harder to really push you to learn and improve your programming skills.
